Description: Provides a reproducible pipeline for nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) 
    of transcriptomic data across multiple ranks, including consensus clustering, 
    visualization, and downstream functional interpretation. Identified factor-specific 
    gene sets are analyzed with Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment (via gprofiler2) 
    to reveal underlying biological processes.
